# JavaHistogramPlotter
I was testing java as C# developer, during I encounter Math.random() function, So I was curious and want to check its probability distribution, So I wrote this simple java program to plot its histogram. you can use it for any randomly generated data and plot its histogram on console. of course it has limitation while printing on console screen.
